A ray-tracer written in Python 2.7

## Examples

## Conclusions

- Python is not built for ray-tracing
- Vector math and trigonometry are very useful.  For example, I used:
  - Sin
  - Inverse Cosine
  - Tangent
  - Pi
  - Angles in radians
  - Sum Vectors
  - Dot Product
  - Magnitude Vector
- Studying in math class is worth-while
