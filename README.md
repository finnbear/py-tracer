A ray-tracer written in Python 2.7

## Examples

## Conclusions

- Python is not built for ray-tracing
- Vector math and trigonometry are very useful.  For example, I used:
  - Sin
  - Inverse Cosine
  - Tangent
  - Distance formula
  - Pi
  - Angles in radians
  - Sum of vectors
  - Dot product
  - Magnitude of vector
  - Position vector
  - Direction vector
  - Linear interpolation
  - Sigmoid function
- Studying in math class is worth-while
