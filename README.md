# py-tracer
A ray-tracer written in Python 2.7

## Examples

![Image Could Not Load.](/frame.png "Some Simple Spheres")  
Very work in progress, reflections and shadows will be added soon

## Features

- 3D camera projection
- Spheres

## Planned Additions

- Reflections
- Shadows
- Refractions
- Additional objects

## Conclusions

- Python is not built for ray-tracing
- Vector math and trigonometry are very useful.  For example, I used:
  - Sin
  - Tangent
  - Distance formula
  - Pi
  - Distance from a line to a point
    - Angles in radians
    - Inverse Cosine
    - Sum of vectors
    - Dot product
    - Magnitude of vector
  - Position vector
  - Direction vector
  - Linear interpolation
  - Sigmoid function
- Studying in math class is worth-while
